# Snake-Game
A snake game that I made. I used a tutorial to make the snake and some rules for the game. 
Then I added my own things. Feel free to give suggestions, I am open to constructive criticism! 
This is a learning experience for me.

Play the game here: http://thebluecoat.weebly.com/my-games.html

RULES:

-Use arrow keys to move.

-The snake gets one block bigger once it eats its food.

-If you get long enough and run into yourself, it's game over.

-If you go out of bounds, it's game over.

-Have Fun!
